= Mirror Github

This script will cycle through all repositories belonging to an organization and clone a mirror of them to a specified directory.

A mirror is a bare repository that is suitable for future cloning, if necessary.

== Installation

  gem install mirror_github

Create a mirror_github_config.yml that contains your GitHub username, password, and organization name.  There is a config_example.yml file that demonstrates the structure.  It will look something like this:

  github:
    username: johnnytest
    password: sOOperSecret
    org: my_orgs_github_account_name

Obviously, the user credentials you define in this file need to have access to the specified organization.

Then:

  mirror_github --config-file=/path/to/your/mirror_github_config.yml --backup-dir=/path/to/github/mirror/directory
